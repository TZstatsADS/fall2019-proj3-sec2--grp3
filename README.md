+ Project summary: In this project, we created a classification engine for facial emotion recognition.
+ The aim of this project is to improve the baseline model of image classification, which uses boosted decision stumps model.
+ The improved model is a multilayer perceptron neural network, which improved the performance compared to the client’s base model.
+ In the model selection stage, we compared and evaluated SVM, Random Forest,  and multilayer perceptron methods.
+ Following are the results:
Baseline model: Boosted decision stumps model achieved 42.2% accuracy
Advanced model: Multilayer perceptron neural model achieved 48.8% accuracy
Here is the comparison between different models:
Random Forest model achieved an accuracy rate of 46.6%,
